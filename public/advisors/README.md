# Advisor Profile Pictures

To complete the advisors section, you need to save profile pictures from each advisor's professional profile (e.g., LinkedIn, company website, etc.).

Here's how to save the images:

1. Visit each advisor's LinkedIn or professional profile
2. Right-click on the profile picture and select "Save Image As" or "Copy Image"
3. Save the images to this folder with the following filenames:
   - michael.jpg (Michael Carlos - DataSolve)
   - kartik.jpg (Kartik Sabharwal - Miniclip)
   - maahi.jpg (Maahi Likhari - Sprung Studios)
   - jazking.jpg (Jazking Isaac Albacea - EA)
   - daniel.jpg (Daniel Collins - Cisco)
   - timothy.jpg (Timothy Chou - Oracle)

After saving the images, the advisors section on the Investors page will automatically load these profile pictures.

Note: The advisor company logos are already created as SVG files in the logos directory.
